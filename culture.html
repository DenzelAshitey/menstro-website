        <h2>Cultural Perspectives on Menstruation Around the World</h2>
        <p>
          Menstruation, a universal biological process, is experienced by women
          worldwide, yet the cultural perceptions and practices surrounding it
          vary significantly. Historically, attitudes towards menstruation have
          ranged from viewing it as a natural and even sacred process to seeing
          it as a source of impurity and taboo. These divergent views have
          shaped the experiences of menstruating individuals in profound ways.
          In Asia, for instance, menstruation is often surrounded by traditional
          beliefs and practices. In India, menstruation is considered taboo in
          many regions, leading to practices such as seclusion and restrictions
          on participating in religious activities. However, there's a growing
          movement towards increasing menstrual awareness and education,
          challenging these age-old stigmas. In Japan, menstruation was
          historically seen as impure, with women facing social restrictions.
          Modern Japan is shifting towards more open discussions about
          menstruation, although some stigmas persist. Similarly, in China,
          traditional beliefs viewed menstrual blood as polluted, but these
          perspectives are gradually changing with the influence of education
          and urbanization. In the Middle East, Islamic practices dictate that
          menstruating women are excused from fasting during Ramadan and certain
          prayers. The views on menstruation vary among different Islamic
          cultures, but there remains a significant level of menstrual stigma in
          some regions, impacting women's education and mobility. For example,
          in some parts of Africa, particularly in Sub-Saharan regions,
          menstrual taboos lead to restrictions on activities and social
          participation. This is slowly changing thanks to the efforts of NGOs
          working to improve menstrual hygiene management and education. In
          Ethiopia, traditional beliefs often involve seclusion and the use of
          makeshift menstrual products, reflecting a broader pattern of
          menstrual-related challenges in the region.
