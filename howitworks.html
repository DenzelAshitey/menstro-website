        <h2>How does menstruation work?</h2>
        <p>
          Menstruation is part of the menstrual cycle, which typically lasts
          about 28 days but can range from 21 to 35 days. The cycle has several
          phases:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):</h4>
            <span
              >During this phase, the uterine lining (endometrium) is shed and
              expelled through the vagina, resulting in bleeding. This bleeding
              is a mixture of blood, mucus, and endometrial tissue.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):</h4>
            <span
              >This phase begins on the first day of menstruation and continues
              until ovulation. The pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating
              hormone (FSH), which stimulates the ovaries to produce follicles.
              Each follicle contains an egg, and as the follicles develop, the
              endometrium starts to thicken in preparation for a potential
              pregnancy.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Ovulation (Day 14):</h4>
            <span>
              Triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH), one mature egg
              is released from a dominant follicle in the ovary. The egg travels
              down the fallopian tube, where it may be fertilized by
              sperm.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):</h4>
            <span
              >After ovulation, the ruptured follicle forms a structure called
              the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone to maintain the
              thickened endometrium. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus
              luteum breaks down, leading to a drop in progesterone and estrogen
              levels. This hormonal decrease triggers the start of a new
              menstrual cycle as the endometrium is shed.</span
