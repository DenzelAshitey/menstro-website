        <h2>Managing Oneself?</h2>
        <p>
          Menstruation is part of the menstrual cycle, which typically lasts
          about 28 days but can range from 21 to 35 days. The cycle has several
          phases:

            <h4>Pads (Sanitary Napkins):</h4>
            <span
              >Pads are a common menstrual product that adheres to underwear to
              absorb menstrual blood. They come in both disposable and reusable
              forms, with various sizes and absorbencies to suit different flow
              levels. Disposable pads need to be changed every 4-6 hours to
              prevent odor and infection and can generate a significant amount
              of waste. Reusable pads are more eco-friendly and can be washed
              and reused multiple times. Pads are easy to use and widely
              available, making them a popular choice for many.</span

            <h4>Tampons:</h4>
            <span
              >Tampons are inserted into the vagina to absorb menstrual blood
              and come in different absorbencies (regular, super, and
              super-plus) with or without applicators. They offer discretion and
              comfort, especially for those with active lifestyles, and help
              reduce odor. Tampons should be changed every 4-8 hours to prevent
              Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), a rare but serious condition. Proper
              insertion is important, and some users may experience vaginal
              dryness with tampons.</span

            <h4>Menstrual Cups:</h4>
            <span>
              Menstrual cups are reusable devices made from silicone, rubber, or
              plastic that are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual
              blood. They can be worn for up to 12 hours, making them a
              convenient option for long-term use. Menstrual cups need to be
              emptied, washed, and reinserted regularly. They are eco-friendly
              and cost-effective over time, though there is an initial learning
              curve for insertion and removal. Proper cleaning is essential to
              maintain hygiene and prevent infections.</span
